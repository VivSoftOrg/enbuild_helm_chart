| Term                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| DevSecOps                         | This is a combination of development, security, and operations. Imagine a team working on creating a software, where everyone from programmers to security experts and IT professionals collaborate closely from the start to the end of a project. This approach ensures that the software is developed quickly, securely, and efficiently.                        |
| Containerization                  | Think of this as packing your entire software, with everything it needs to run (like code, libraries, and system tools), into a single package or 'container'. This container can then be easily moved and run on different computers or servers, much like how you might pack your belongings into a suitcase when traveling, ensuring you have everything you need wherever you go. |
| Kubernetes                        | This is like a conductor for an orchestra, but instead of managing musical instruments, it manages containers (those packages mentioned earlier). Kubernetes helps in organizing and automating the deployment, scaling (adjusting the size or capacity), and management of containerized applications, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently.               |
| Helm Deployments                  | Helm is akin to a package manager for Kubernetes. Just as you might use a tool on your computer to install, update, or manage software, Helm does this for Kubernetes applications. It works with packages called 'charts', which are collections of information necessary to create a standardized deployment on Kubernetes. This makes installing and managing Kubernetes applications as easy as installing apps on your smartphone. |
| Terraform Infrastructure Deployments | Terraform is a tool that allows you to describe your infrastructure (like servers, databases, and networks) using code. This approach lets you set up and manage your infrastructure through code files, which can be versioned, reused, and shared. Imagine building a model city where you can design and rearrange buildings, roads, and parks with a few clicks. Terraform does something similar for computer infrastructure, allowing for easy adjustments and replication across different environments. |
| GitLab and GitHub Integration     | GitLab and GitHub are platforms that allow developers to store their code, track changes, and collaborate with others. Integrating with these platforms means ENBUILD can automatically interact with your code stored on GitLab or GitHub, helping automate parts of the development process like testing and deployment, much like how social media apps can share information to keep everything in sync. |
| CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) | This is a practice in software development where every time a developer makes changes to the code (continuous integration), those changes are automatically tested and then deployed to the live application (continuous deployment). It's like a factory assembly line for software, where new features are added, tested, and made available to users seamlessly and efficiently.                     |
| NoSQL Database                   | Unlike traditional databases that store data in tables, a NoSQL database uses a more flexible format (like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs). This flexibility allows for easier storage and retrieval of data in various formats, making it suitable for applications that handle diverse and large amounts of data, such as social networks or e-commerce sites.                           |
| Helm Chart                        | A Helm chart is a package containing all the necessary information to run an application or service on Kubernetes. It includes details on how the application should be configured and deployed, similar to a recipe that outlines the ingredients and steps needed to make a dish.                                                                                   |
| RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) | RBAC is a method for restricting system access to authorized users. It's like having different keys for different rooms in a building; depending on your role (e.g., manager, employee), you're given keys (access) only to the areas you need to perform your job.                                                                                                            |
| Iron Bank Accredited Containers  | Iron Bank refers to a repository of secure container images that have been approved for use within certain secure environments, such as government or military. Think of it as a library of vetted, safe-to-use building blocks for software that meet high security standards.                                                                                         |
| GitOps                            | This is a way to manage your infrastructure and applications by using Git (a version control system) as the single source of truth. It's like maintaining a detailed blueprint for a machine; any changes to the blueprint automatically update the machine, ensuring it always matches the design specifications.                                                                    |
| KubeFlow                          | KubeFlow is a project aimed at making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable. Imagine if you could set up a complex scientific experiment with all its equipment and processes in a box, move it anywhere, and have it work the same way every timeâ€”that's what KubeFlow does for ML projects.                                            |
| Landing Zones                     | In cloud computing, a landing zone is a predefined environment with a set of policies, tools, and computing resources. It's prepared ground for new applications or services, ensuring they have a secure and efficient place to operate from the moment they're deployed.                                                                                                      |
| Service Mesh                      | A service mesh is a layer that controls how different parts of an application share data with one another. It's like a sophisticated system within a busy city that manages how cars (data) navigate the streets (network) to ensure smooth traffic flow and delivery of passengers (services) to their destinations safely and efficiently.                                              |
