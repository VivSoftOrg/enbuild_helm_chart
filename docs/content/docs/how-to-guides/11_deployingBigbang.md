# Bigbang

Big Bang is a declarative, continuous delivery tool for deploying DoD hardened and approved packages into a Kubernetes cluster. More details are found [Here](https://enbuild-docs.vivplatform.io/docs/references/platform-one-big-bang/)

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
- You have created the KMS encryption key to encrypt your cluster and have the ARN of the KMS key handy.
- You have deployed the Kubernetes and have access to `kubeconfig` file.
- All your worker nodes have instance profile with a policy to use KMS:decrypt

## KMS encryption key

The KMS encryption provider uses an envelope encryption scheme to encrypt data in etcd. The data is encrypted using a data encryption key (DEK). The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) that is stored and managed in a remote KMS

## Create the KMS encryption key

You can create manually or via automation. Its of type **Customer-managed keys** and make sure the person deploying the bigbang is added into the key policy to allow ` kms:Encrypt` and `kms:Decrypt`

Once created and note down the ARN of the KMS key you created, and create the sops.yaml file in below format , changing the ` ADD_YOUR_KMS_KEY_ARN_HERE` with your actual `ARN`.

This file we will use whole deploying BigBang.

```
---
creation_rules:
  - kms: ADD_YOUR_KMS_KEY_ARN_HERE 
    encrypted_regex: "^(data|stringData)$"
```

## Create Kubernetes Cluster

It does not matter how you create the kubernetes cluster , but you should have access to kubeconfig file.

The cluster also have enough resources ( memory/cpu/) to run the bigbang nodes.

The cluster-api server should be publicly accessible so that public gitlab ci-cd can access it.

## Worker node instance Profile

All worker nodes in your cluster must have an instance profile , which have a policy to allowing the kms:decrypt and describe permission,

See, sample policy below , Change your KMS key ARN

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:DescribeKey",
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "ADD_YOUR_KMS_KEY_ARN_HERE"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Create GPG Encryption Key

Generate the gpg key with name `bigbang-sops`

```
# Generate a GPG master key
# The GPG key fingerprint will be stored in the $fp variable
export fp=`gpg --quick-generate-key bigbang-sops rsa4096 encr | sed -e 's/ *//;2q;d;'`
gpg --quick-add-key ${fp} rsa4096 encr

echo ${fp}
```

# GPG Key Generation Script Variables

# `fp`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** The fingerprint of the GPG master key.
- **How it's set:** This variable is set by running the `gpg --quick-generate-key` command and extracting the fingerprint using `sed`.
- **Default value:** N/A (set dynamically at runtime)
- **Example usage:**

  ```bash
  export fp=`gpg --quick-generate-key bigbang-sops rsa4096 encr | sed -e 's/ *//;2q;d;'`

Now create a secret in your cluster with SOPS private key for Big Bang to decrypt secrets at run time.

```
kubectl create namespace bigbang

gpg --export-secret-key --armor ${fp} | kubectl create secret generic sops-gpg -n bigbang --from-file=bigbangkey.asc=/dev/stdin

kubectl get secret -n bigbang sops-gpg
```
The sops value for your BigBang Deployment will be as below,

```
---
creation_rules:
- encrypted_regex: '^(data|stringData)$'
  pgp: EEF17D87C3954A2AE9D406811D17192D335BBD12
```

## Deploy BigBang

-  Login to Enbuild -[Enbuild](https://enbuild.vivplatform.io)
-  Click on the **Home**
-  Select the **Platform One BigBang**
-  At the SOPS tab provide the `sops.yaml` created on SOPS prerequisite section.

<picture><img src="/images/how-to-guides/SOPS.png" alt="SOPS"></img></picture>

-  At the REPO tab , provide the
   <ol type="a"> 
     <li> Registry URL â€” The container registry from where you are pulling the images for flux deployment. </li> <li> Registry Username - The container registry username to pull flux images </li>   <li>Registry Password - The container registry password to pull flux images</li> <li>Repository Username -  The gitlab repository username to pull the BigBang Helm chart. We have cloned the chart at <a href="https://gitlab.com/enbuild-staging/charts/bigbang.git" target="_blank">chart</a></lI> <li>Repository Password - The gitlab repository password to pull the BigBang Helm chart. (We have cloned the chart at <a href="https://gitlab.com/enbuild-staging/charts/bigbang.git" target="_blank">chart</a>) </li>
     </ol>

     <picture><img src="/images/how-to-guides/repoCreds.png" alt="Repo Credentials"></img></picture>

- Next, choose the component **Repo** from the **settings** category and click on the **SECRETS** tab and provide the `registryCredentials`and `git credentials`  this is basically used by BigBang Helm chart to pull the container images and cloning the dependant helm charts used by bigbang.

<picture><img src="/images/how-to-guides/repoSecrets.png" alt="Repo Secrets"></img></picture>

  - The values of these will be same as previous section.

```
  registryCredentials:
  registry: registry.gitlab.com
  username: registry_username
  password: registry_password
  email: ""
git:
  credentials:
  username: repository_usernane
  password: registry_password
```

-  Similarly you can check other components and edit the values of the component deployment. If you feel the value is sensitive you can add that in secrets tab, so that enbuild will encrypt it using the KMS key provided before committing to the git repo.

# The different types of components avalable are listed below: 

# settings Tool

- **Repo** -Domain used for BigBang created exposed services, can be overridden by individual packages.

# Service Mesh Tools

- **Istio** - Istio extends Kubernetes to establish a programmable, application-aware network using the powerful Envoy service proxy. Working with both Kubernetes and traditional workloads, Istio brings standard, universal traffic management, telemetry, and security to complex deployments.
- **Istio Operator** - Instead of manually installing, upgrading, and uninstalling Istio, you can instead let the Istio operator manage the installation for you. This relieves you of the burden of managing different istioctl versions. Simply update the operator custom resource (CR) and the operator controller will apply the corresponding configuration changes for you.
- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing observability platforms, such as Jaeger, are essential for modern software applications that are architected as microservices. Jaeger maps the flow of requests and data as they traverse a distributed system. These requests may make calls to multiple services, which may introduce their own delays or errors. Jaeger connects the dots between these disparate components, helping to identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot errors, and improve overall application reliability. Jaeger is 100% open source, cloud native, and infinitely scalable.
- **Kiali** - Kiali is a console for Istio service mesh. Kiali can be quickly installed as an Istio add-on, or trusted as a part of your production environment.

One important component setting while deploying BigBang is

`domain: dev.bigbang.mil` which is present in Settings â†’ Repo â†’ Values. This defines the istio ingress domain on which the bigbang applications will be available.

<picture><img src="/images/how-to-guides/repoValues.png" alt="Repo Values"></img></picture>

You also have to provide the right tls certificate and key for the same domain defined above in the Component â†’ Service Mesh â†’ Istio â†’ Secrets tab. So that you can access the bigbang applications in browser without any security/certificate warning.

<picture><img src="/images/how-to-guides/istioSecrets.png" alt="Istio secrets"></img></picture>

- After providing all the input values, provide the name for your deployment proceed to Infrastructure section, and provide your 
  -    kubeconfig file - Paste your `kubeconfig` file
  -    Select AWS as your cloud and provide your AWS credentials. These AWS credentials are used to encrypt the secrets using SOPS. So make sure the IAM user of these credentials is having `kms:Encrypt` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions.
